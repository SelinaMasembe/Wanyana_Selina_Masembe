"""
TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING:
1.Supervised Learning
2.Unsupervised Learning
3.Semi supervised learning- uses both supervised and unsupervised learning
4.Reinforcement Learning-uses rewards

#SUPERVISED LEARNING - labelled dataset [in csv or json files], structured
"""
Common algorithms with Supervised learning:
.Linear Regression
.Logistic Regression
.Decision trees
.Support vector machine (SVM)
.K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
.Random Forest(RF)

.Deep learning (CNN ) -image classification
CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
definition:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. It uses convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input data, making it highly effective for tasks like image recognition and classification.

#UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
"""
-used on unlabeled data
-to discover hidden patterns
